A comprehensive learning app that combines Jetpack Compose tutorials with coding interview preparation through LeetCode-style algorithmic challenges.

## üì± Overview

ComposeCodeLab is an all-in-one learning platform for Android developers looking to master both modern Android UI development with Jetpack Compose and improve their algorithmic problem-solving skills for technical interviews.

The app features two main modules:

1. **Compose Course** - A structured learning path for Jetpack Compose based on the official Android Developers codelab materials, redesigned with a custom interface and interactive elements.

2. **LeetCode Challenges** - A curated collection of the most frequently asked algorithmic interview questions, organized by difficulty level with detailed explanations and optimal solutions.

## ‚ú® Features

### Compose Course Module
- Step-by-step tutorials for learning Jetpack Compose
